# Day 01: Basics of Linear Algebra

linear algebra is used to represent data, perform matrix operations, and solve equations in algorithms like regression, pca, and neural networks.

- Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, Tensors: Basic data structures for ML.

- Linear Combination and Span: Representing data points as weighted sums. Used in Linear Regression and neural networks.

- Determinants: Matrix invertibility, unique solutions in linear regression.
- Dot and Cross Product: Similarity (e.g., in SVMs) and vector transformations.

Slow progress right?? but consistent wins the race!
